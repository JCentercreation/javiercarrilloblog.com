As you may know, concurrency is a very interesting tool when it comes, for instante, to network calls. In that case we do not want to pause all the tasks that our app is running just because networks functions are running, mainly because that behaviour would freeze the user interface tasks that are updating the views and letting the user to keep flowing throught the app. So thats why it is better to perform all network functions as an asynchronous ones.

When it comes to Concurrency in Swift we are in reallity talking about asynchronous and parallel tasks. Asynchronous tasks are those that can be suspended and resumed when needed in order to let other tasks with a higher level of priority to be runned, and parallel tasks are those that are able to be executed ate the same time in through a multicore processor.

The main example of an asynchronous function is a closure one (callback), and these sort of functions are really useful. But sometimes, when we use a closure inside another closure inside another closure it turns out that it is very difficult to follow the code and to figure out what is the real sequence of the process. Let's see a quick example of this:
